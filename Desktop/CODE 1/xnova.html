    <h3><u>Past</u></h3>
    <h4><u>Pre Military</u></h4>
<b>Simon Riley</b> had a very traumatic childhood while growing up in Manchester, England because of his heartless father. On most days, his father brought dangerous animals back and taunted him with them, even going so far to force him to kiss a snake or threaten to kill him with them. When he and his younger brother Tommy got older, Tommy would always wear a skull-mask at night to scare Simon. Simon's father would sometimes take him to the Bone Lickers concerts. At one concert, his father made him laugh at the death of a prostitute who was addicted to drugs.

    <h4><u>Joining the Military</u></h4>
Simon used to be an apprentice butcher at a grocery when he grew up. After the September 11 attacks occurred, he joined the military. He was an expert soldier which got him into the Special Air Service.

In some Desert in the Texas state, Ghost attacked a hideout used by a group of mercenaries and killed them off swiftly. He then goes into the basement along with his team, where he discovers that Makarov was using the lab to try and recreate Nova Gas, and was also using it as a missile silo that had missiles containing the replicated Nova Gas. The team is then ambushed by Makarov, who releases the gas and a team of mercenaries in Hazmat Suits. Ghost barely makes it out while his whole team is killed. Makarov then remotely launches the missiles, and Ghost can do nothing to stop them.

<h4>Hunting Rojas</h4>
<blockquote>Following Makarov's massacre at Zakhaev International Airport, Ghost assisted in the operation in Rio de Janeiro to locate and capture Alejandro Rojas, the man who supplied Makarov with weapons and ammunition, maintaining radio contact with Captain MacTavish and Roach while they searched for Rojas' assistant. After MacTavish and Roach began pursuing the assistant, Ghost met up with them at the Hotel Rio and joined the chase. Once the assistant was taken down by Roach, Ghost prepared to interrogate him through torture. Ghost was heard via radio for the rest of the mission as he attempted to pursue Rojas through the favela. After the capture of Rojas, Ghost was heard requesting extraction from Command, but to no avail. Despite this, Ghost managed to narrowly escape the favela with Captain MacTavish and Roach aboard Nikolai's helicopter.</blockquote

<em>Ghost arrives</em> in one of the cities Makarov targeted with Tank Dempsey, noting that it looked like the end of the world. As they search for clues, Tank notes that there was no tactical reason to target the city, but Ghost pulls him into cover as they are ambushed. Ghost kills the ambusher, a clown, and Tank picks up his weapon, noting that it was probably supplied from somewhere. The duo then finds an abandoned Gulag that was used as a hideout for Krueger and Mace. As Tank engages Krueger, Ghost engages Mace. Ghost throws a grenade, disarming Mace, which lead them fighting in the Showers hand to hand. As they were fighting, Tank arrives after failing to take down Krueger and fires at Mace, causing him to retreat. The two then descend down a staircase and encounter Reznov, who is in his early hundreds
